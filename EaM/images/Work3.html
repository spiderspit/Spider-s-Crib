        <div>The Moon is an astronomical body that orbits planet <a href="Work2.html">Earth</a>, being Earth's only permanent natural satellite. It is the fifth-largest natural satellite in the 
                <br/>Solar System, and the largest among planetary satellites relative to the size of the planet that it orbits (its primary).
                <br/> Following Jupiter's satellite Io,
                <br/>the Moon is the second-densest satellite in the Solar System among those whose densities are known.
